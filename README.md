# Gaiwan's .emacs.d

- Corgi-based
- Supports a gitignored `local.el` for local tweaks
- magit, org, markdown, yaml, typescript, etc.
- color theme that seems to work well across terminal emulators
- some pre-set registers for quick Clojure eval of common commands
- Always have a babashka REPL ready
